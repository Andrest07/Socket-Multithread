# Socket program with multi threading
The socket program we have helps us to connect a client to a server. Client.py file is message sender and receiver and server.py file is just a listener that works on data sent by client.


Installation guide, after you download the client and server python file, you run the server file then the client file.

You need to run both the client and server file in a separate console, or it will not output anything and result in an error.

After running the server and client code, the client code reverses the output of the server code which is seen above.
